        Itching to stretch my web-redesign muscles, I was on the hunt for a website that not only needed a visual update, but was also actually relevant to me and my peers. After asking around, my friend led me to the <a href="https://usaco.org/index.php">USA Computing Olympiad website</a> -- he had participated in one of their contests when he was younger but the outdated design of their site always stuck with him.
